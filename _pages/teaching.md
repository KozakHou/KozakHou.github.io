For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!





I am a master's student advised by [Gerard Gorman](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.gorman/about) in the MSc [Applied Computational Science and Engineering program](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/applied-computational-science/) at Imperial College London. My research interests are in applied science and machine learning. Recently, I have been working on developing a machine learning model [Regression-based Physics Informed Neural Networks](https://kozakhou.github.io/projects/1_project/) for empirical equation on EVERY applied sciences. I am fortunate to have received sponsorship from the [Centre for Computational Methods in Science and Engineering (CMSE)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computational-methods/about-us/).

Prior to my master's, I completed my bachelor's degree in Space Science and Engineering with a credit program in Interdicipline Artificial Intilligence at National Central University in Taiwan (2020-2024). I was privileged to be advised by [Chun-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/lincytw/) and [Jih-Hong Shue](http://themis.ss.ncu.edu.tw/e_taiwan_themis.htm) for their guidance in high-performance scientific computing and numerical methods in space physics.
