<br>

I am a master's student enrolled in the MSc [Applied Computational Science and Engineering program](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/applied-computational-science/) at Imperial College London. My research interests are in applied science and machine learning. Recently, I have been working on developing a machine learning model [Regression-based Physics Informed Neural Networks](https://kozakhou.github.io/projects/1_project/) for empirical equations across all fields of applied science, especially in electromagnetic wave and plasma simulation.

Prior to my master's, I completed my bachelor's degree in Space Science and Engineering with a credit program in Interdicipline Artificial Intilligence at National Central University in Taiwan (2020-2024). I was privileged to be advised by [Chun-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/lincytw/) and [Jih-Hong Shue](http://themis.ss.ncu.edu.tw/e_taiwan_themis.htm) for their guidance in high-performance scientific computing and numerical methods in space physics
