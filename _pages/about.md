Prior to my PhD, I was supervised by [Dr. Adriana Paluszny Rodriguez](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/apaluszn/about) (Imperial College London) and coadvised by Professor Naoto Tsujii in the MSc Applied Computational Science and Engineering program (2024) at Imperial College London. I also completed my bachelor's degree in Space Science and Engineering with a credit program in Interdicipline Artificial Intilligence at National Central University in Taiwan (2020-2024). I was privileged to be advised by [Chun-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/lincytw/) and [Jih-Hong Shue](https://scholars.ncu.edu.tw/en/persons/jih-hong-shue) for their guidance in high-performance scientific computing and numerical methods in space physics.
