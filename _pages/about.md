I am an incomping PhD student (2026 Fall) in Nuclear Fusion Research at the [Graduate School of Frontier Science](https://orchidhare82.sakura.ne.jp/fusion-pro/en/),University of Tokyo, under the supervision of [Professor Naoto Tsujii](https://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/gsfs/faculty/naoto_tsujii/) in the [Ejiri–Tsujii Laboratory](https://fusion.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html). My research interests are in applied science via high performance computing, including fusion plasma modelling and machine learning surrogate. Recently, I have been working on accelerating Two-Dimensional Lower Hybrid Wave code via Physics-Informed Neural Operator on TST-2 spherical tokamak located at University of Tokyo, Kashiwa Campus.

Prior to my PhD, I was supervised by [Dr. Adriana Paluszny Rodriguez](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/apaluszn/about) (Imperial College London) and coadvised by Professor Naoto Tsujii in the MSc Applied Computational Science and Engineering program (2024) at Imperial College London. I also completed my bachelor's degree in Space Science and Engineering with a credit program in Interdicipline Artificial Intilligence at National Central University in Taiwan (2020-2024). I was privileged to be advised by [Chun-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/lincytw/) and [Jih-Hong Shue](https://scholars.ncu.edu.tw/en/persons/jih-hong-shue) for their guidance in high-performance scientific computing and numerical methods in space physics.
