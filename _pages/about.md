I am a master's student supervised by [Professor Naoto Tsujii](https://fusion.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html) (University of Tokyo) and coadvised by [Dr. Marijan Beg](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.beg) (Imperial College London) in the MSc [Applied Computational Science and Engineering program](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/applied-computational-science/) at Imperial College London. My research interests are in applied science via high performance computing. Recently, I have been working on accelerating Two-Dimensional Lower Hybrid Wave code via Physics-Informed Neural Operator on TST-2 spherical tokamak located at University of Tokyo, Kashiwa Campus.

Prior to my master's, I completed my bachelor's degree in Space Science and Engineering with a credit program in Interdicipline Artificial Intilligence at National Central University in Taiwan (2020-2024). I was privileged to be advised by [Chun-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/lincytw/) and [Jih-Hong Shue](https://scholars.ncu.edu.tw/en/persons/jih-hong-shue) for their guidance in high-performance scientific computing and numerical methods in space physics.
