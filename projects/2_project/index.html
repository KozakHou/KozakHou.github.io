It is a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics and is used to model a wide range of physical phenomena. The advection equation is given by:</p> \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0\] <p>or in vector form:</p> \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (u \mathbf{v}) = 0\] <p>where \(u\) is the quantity being transported, \(\mathbf{v}\) is the velocity field, and \(\nabla \cdot\) is the divergence operator. The advection equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation and is known to exhibit sharp gradients and discontinuities in the solution. This makes it challenging to solve numerically, especially when the velocity field is complex or discontinuous.</p> <p><br></p> <h2 id="numerical-methods">Numerical Methods</h2> <p>There are several numerical methods that can be used to solve the advection equation. Some of the most common methods include finite difference methods, finite volume methods, and finite element methods. These methods discretize the advection equation in space and time and solve the resulting system of algebraic equations to obtain an approximate solution. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and may not be accurate for problems with sharp gradients or discontinuities.</p> <p><br></p> <h4 id="finite-difference-methods-fdm"><strong>Finite Difference Methods (FDM)</strong></h4> <p>Finite difference methods discretize the advection equation in space and time using a grid of points. The equation is approximated at each grid point using a finite difference approximation, and the resulting system of algebraic equations is solved using an iterative method. Finite difference methods are simple to implement and are computationally efficient for problems with smooth solutions. However, they can be inaccurate for problems with sharp gradients or discontinuities.</p> <p><br></p> <h5 id="how-to-obtain-the-discrete-form-from-differential-equation-via-fdm-">How to obtain the discrete form from differential equation via FDM ?</h5> <p><br></p> <h6 id="forward-difference-approximation"><strong>Forward Difference Approximation</strong></h6> <p>The forward difference approximation is a simple method for approximating the derivative of a function at a point.

We can also observe that the PINNs have a slightly oscillatory behavior in the residual plot, which is due to the neural network’s approximation of the solution, whereas the FDM and FVM have a more stable behavior. This can be seen as evidence that the PINNs are able to capture the solution of the advection equation with high accuracy but may require more computational resources to achieve the same level of accuracy as the FDM and FVM. Nevertheless, this issue is too simple to be considered a major drawback of the PINNs, and PINNs can be a powerful tool for solving complex problems in fluid dynamics and other fields which generally require high computational resources. With the advantage of high efficiency in inferring the solution with inarguable accuracy, PINNs can be a better choice.</p> <p><br></p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ul> <li> <p>Chakraverty, S., Mahato, N., Karunakar, P., &amp; Rao, T.
